Add Content\rThe following command will add a new page to the site.\n1 hugo new content posts/my-first-post.md This command will create two things:\nA posts directory, if one does not already exist A markdown file titled \u0026ldquo;My First Post\u0026rdquo; Multiple pages can be created if running the command again but with a different page name.\nFor instance, I ran the following which created two pages under my posts directory:\n1 2 hugo new content posts/setting-up-hugo.md hugo new content posts/notes.md Front Matter\rOpen any one of the page files. Notice there are a few auto populated fields at the top of each file.\nThese fields compose the Front Matter, which is used to add metadata to the page.\n1 2 3 4 5 +++ title = \u0026#39;Setting Up Hugo\u0026#39; date = 2024-06-01T16:03:07-04:00 draft = true +++ The title and date fields add their respective details to the page.\nThe draft field is used to tell hugo whether or not this page is a draft.\nBy default, draft pages are not published when the site gets built.\nMore fields can be added to the Front Matter but for now these are the default fields.\nMarkdown\rMarkdown is the primary language for formatting the .md files used for these pages.\nCheck out the Markdown Getting Started guide for more information.\nIn Hugo we\u0026rsquo;ll mostly be using Markdown. However, using HTML is also an option. This would allow us to use JavaScript through script tags, use CSS through style tags, handle additional formatting, and more. By default, HTML is unavailable but we are able to use other markdown processors in order to enable it. I\u0026rsquo;ll include how I did that in a separate post.\nI created a Markdown Example page with examples of markdown formatting.\nAdding Markdown\rAdd some markdown to the nearly created page file.\nMake sure to keep draft = true while working on a draft page.\nHere is an example of what I added from the top of this page.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 +++ title = \u0026#39;Setting Up Hugo\u0026#39; date = 2024-06-01T16:03:07-04:00 draft = true +++ # Prerequisites Navigate to the [hugo quick start page](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) - [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/windows/) - [Install Git](https://www.git-scm.com/download/win) Git and GitBash were already installed prior to hugo setup. Run the Server\rSave the changes and start the Hugo development server.\nTo include draft pages run either of the following commands:\n1 2 hugo server --buildDrafts hugo server -D To exclude draft pages run the following command:\n1 hugo server The site URL will be printed in the terminal.\nNavigate to the site and continue working while keeping the server running. The site will update live as changes are made.\nFrom the Hugo Quick Start page:\nHugoâ€™s rendering engine conforms to the CommonMark specification for Markdown. The CommonMark organization provides a useful live testing tool powered by the reference implementation.\nConfigure the Site\rAt the root of this project, open the hugo.toml file. This file handles the hugo configuration fields for the site.\nIt was auto generated when we ran the hugo new site command in the Creating a Site section of this page.\nThese are the base fields added to the file:\n1 2 3 4 baseURL = \u0026#39;https://example.org/\u0026#39; languageCode = \u0026#39;en-us\u0026#39; title = \u0026#39;My New Hugo Site\u0026#39; theme = \u0026#39;ananke\u0026#39; It is recommended to change the following fields when starting:\nbaseUrl: Must begin with the protocol and end with a slash. Customize it however desired. languageCode: Set this to your local language and region or a desired one. title: Update this to reflect on your site as the main title. Here are the values I currently have in my configuration file:\n1 2 3 4 5 baseURL = \u0026#39;https://tyotalks.org/\u0026#39; languageCode = \u0026#39;en-us\u0026#39; title = \u0026#39;Tyo Talks\u0026#39; theme = \u0026#39;diary\u0026#39; enableEmoji = true Notice I changed the theme 1 and added a new field to enable emojis.\nTo see the changes take effect, start the server once again.\n1 hugo server -D Publish the Site\rIn order to deploy the site it will first need to be published.\nPublishing the site and deploying the site are not the same thing.\nTo publish the site run the following command:\n1 hugo When you publish your site:\nThe entire static site gets created in the public directory Draft, future, or expired pages should not be included Summary\rIn this document we:\nInstalled Hugo and software Created a new site project Added page content to the site Briefly discussed front matter Introduced markdown Added markdown to a page Ran the local server Configured the site Published the site Thank you for following along and I hope this document was helpful!\nReferences\rA comprehensive list of page references\nHugo Documents\rHugo Quick Start Hugo Modules Front Matter Configure Hugo Draft, Future, and Expired Content Hugo Methods\rTitle Page Method Date Page Method Draft Page Method BaseURL Site Method Language Site Method Title Site Method Markdown\rMarkdown Getting Started Markdown Example CommonMark Specification CommonMark Live Testing Tool Installs\rInstall Hugo Install Go Install Scoop Install Git The chosen theme can be changed later.
