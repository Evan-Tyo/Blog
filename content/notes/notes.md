# Project ideas

### Mock Discord
A webpage with the ability to make a new category, a new channel, and new posts.\
Nothing fancy but I think thatâ€™s a good simple showcase of CRUD functionality and full stack development.

# Configure CI/CD
The resources being created here will be made to connect a GitHub repository to GitLabs.\
This will utilize a GitLabs CI/CD project in order to make that connection.

> I already have a GitHub account with multiple repositories created.\
I don't plan to create any docs on setting that up, but if I do I'll reference that here.\
Either way I suggest setting up a GitHub account and aiming to use it frequently.

1) Create a Group
2) Create a Project
3) Conect With Personal Access Token\
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/ci_cd_for_external_repos/github_integration.html
4) Configure GitLab CI/CD\
Can skip setting up runners since using GitLab.com\
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/index.html
5) BaseURL
6) Push your Hugo website to GitLab
7) Wait for your page to build
