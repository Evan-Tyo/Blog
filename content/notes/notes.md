# Overview
General notes, ideas, and an information dump.

---

# Page Ideas

**Changing the theme**
Include theme info and what failed / worked.\
Add information for hugo-theme-stack and updating the scss.

**Exploring HTML**
To set up html needed to add goldmark.\

---

# Project Ideas

**Mock Discord**
A webpage with the ability to make a new category, a new channel, and new posts.\
Nothing fancy but I think thatâ€™s a good simple showcase of CRUD functionality and full stack development.

# Configure CI/CD (Include this in the deploying to gitlabs page)
The resources being created here will be made to connect a GitHub repository to GitLabs.\
This will utilize a GitLabs CI/CD project in order to make that connection.

> I already have a GitHub account with multiple repositories created.\
I don't plan to create any docs on setting that up, but if I do I'll reference that here.\
Either way I suggest setting up a GitHub account and aiming to use it frequently.

1) Create a Group
2) Create a Project
3) Conect With Personal Access Token\
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/ci_cd_for_external_repos/github_integration.html
4) Configure GitLab CI/CD\
Can skip setting up runners since using GitLab.com\
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/index.html
5) BaseURL
6) Push your Hugo website to GitLab
7) Wait for your page to build

**MongoDB Database**
Amazon Web Services, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.\
I've already worked with Azure, although it's been some years.\
We also work with AWS some at work.\
Maybe I'll explore GCP first.

# Stuff
- Put a ling break at the bottom of each page to section off the tags from the theme
- Update the css for the right column table of contents to remove so much white space between bullets


FOLLOW THIS
Will probably have to make a new project and correctly outline those steps
