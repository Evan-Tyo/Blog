# Understanding Groups and Projects
This section is meant to breifly explain what Groups and Projects are.

### Groups
Groups are used to categorize one or more projects together that have a shared purpose.

There are many different ways to structure a group, but there is no single correct way.\
Here are a few common group structures:
- <u>Simple</u>: One group including all projects
- <u>Team</u>: Each team has their own group
- <u>Client</u>: Each client has their own group
- <u>Functionality</u>: Each functionality has it's own group

Using groups allows for:
- Managing permissions for projects included in the group
- Viewing all issues, requests, and analytics for projects in the group
- Communicate with all group members within a group
- Creating subgroups for additional structuring

There are two options for creating a group:
- Create Group: Design a group from scratch
- Import Group: Pull in a group from another GitLab instance

For more details involving groups navigate to the [GitLab Groups](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/) page.

### Projects
Projects are used to host the data related to the associated development work.

They provide a variety of great benefits to help streamline the development process.\
Using projects allows for:
- Collaboration between project members
- Version control for more secure releases
- Project management to assist with planning
- The use of a dedicated environment

While all projects have the same functionality, there are different ways to create a project.\
A few ways to create a project are by:
- Creating a blank project
- Using a template
- Utilizing Git push
- Including SHA-256 hashing

For more general details involving projects navigate to the [GitLab Projects](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/get_started/get_started_projects.html) page.\
Additionally, the [GitLab Create a Project](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/index.html) page provides more information on project creation.
