### Front Matter
Open any one of the page files.  Notice there are a few auto populated fields at the top of each file.\
These fields compose the [Front Matter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/), which is used to add metadata to the page.

```

The [title](https://gohugo.io/methods/page/title/) and [date](https://gohugo.io/methods/page/date/) fields add their respective details to the page.

The [draft](https://gohugo.io/methods/page/draft/) field is used to tell hugo whether or not this page is a draft.\
By default, draft pages are not published when the site gets built.

More fields can be added to the [Front Matter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/) but for now these are the default fields.
