# Overview
Researching pgAdmin and learning about the app.

# What is pgAdmin
pgAdmin is an "Open Source management tool for PostgreSQL" as stated on the [pgAdmin Latest Docs](https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/latest/index.html) page. It's included as an optional component when installing PostgreSQL as it's considered the official PostgreSQL management tool.

### Why pgAdmin
Being the official tool, pgAdmin is considered the most beginner friendly method of starting with PostgreSQL. Since I'm a beginner with PostgreSQL I figured it was the best option for me.\

Additional reasons:
- Convenient download included with installation process
- Seamless integration with PostgreSQL databases
- Free, with no paid tiers

### Alternatives
While doing research I read a majority of comments referring to DBeaver as a great alternative. DBeaver was being considered better for more experiences users, with pgAdmin great for beginners. More information can be found on the [DBeaver Website](https://dbeaver.io/).

Below are a few articles that outline differences in popular PostgreSQL GUI tools.

- [8 PostgreSQL GUI Tools for 2025](https://www.nimblechapps.com/blog/8-postgresql-gui-tools-for-2025)

### Installation
There are a few methods that pgAdmin can be installed.

#### PostgreSQL
During the PostgreSQL installation, pgAdmin can be chosen as a component for download. This is a convenient way to start using pgAdmin since no additional steps are necessary.

Check out the [PostgreSQL | Introduction]({{< ref "postgresql-introduction" >}}) page for steps on the PostgreSQL install.

#### pgAdmin
The pgAdmin application can also be directly downloaded and installed from their website. This might be preferred for decoupled downloads, or version updates.

Check out the [pgAdmin Download](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/) page for more information.

# Intro to pgAdmin
Consider checking out the [pgAdmin Getting Started](https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/latest/getting_started.html) page in the pgAdmin docs. Their docs are very information, but are also very bulky. Because of this I'll reference them as needed.

### Video resources
The below YouTube videos were beneficial resources for introducing me to pgAdmin. They are relatively short and only dive into the basics. I suggest giving them a watch as a starting point.
