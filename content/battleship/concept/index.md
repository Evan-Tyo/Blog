# Overview
General design, concept, and planning for the Battleship project.

---

# Concept
Creating an online game of Battleship.

### Purpose
To create a fullstack application project to build up my portfolio.\
This project is not being built for general use, only for expressing my abilities.

### Game Guidelines
A list of guidelines for the game of Battleship.

#### Object:
- Sink all of your opponents ships

#### Overview:
- Two player game
- 10 x 10 grid system
- 5 ships per player

#### Ships:
- Carrier - 5 length
- Battleship - 4 length
- Cruiser - 3 length
- Submarine - 3 length
- Destroyer - 2 length

#### Rules:
- Each player places their ships on their board, hidden from the other player.
- Ships are placed either horizontally, or vertically.
- Ships may not overlap.
- Ships may not be placed off the board.
- Ship positions are fixed, and cannot be changed.
- On a players turn, that player will chose a coordinate to attack.
- If the chosen coordinate corresponds with the opposing player's ship, that's a "hit".
- If it does not correspond, then it is a "miss".
- Once every coordinate of a ship has been "hit" that ship is then "sunk".
- Once all five ships of the opposing player are "sunk" then the current player wins.
