# Overview
This post will document my process in setting up GitLabs using this project.\
Which is interesting, so I guess I'll deploy it as is and add this after it's deployed.

---

# Prerequisites
Navigate to the [host on gitlab page](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-gitlab/)

- Have familiarity with Git versioning
- Create a [GitLab account](https://about.gitlab.com/)
- Complete [Hugo Quick Start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)

Completing the hugo quick start turtorial will produce a local, ready to publish, Hugo website.\
If this has not been completed, take a look at my [Setting Up Hugo]({{< ref "setting-up-hugo" >}}) page for more information.
