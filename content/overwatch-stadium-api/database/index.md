# Supabase
Process in setting up a Supabase account for PostgreSQL use.

### Creating an account
Navigate to the [Supabase Website](https://supabase.com/).

> I would recommend reading up on the [Supabase Docs](https://supabase.com/docs) to familiarize with the service. Considering I'll be hosting a PostgreSQL database on Supabase, I took a look through the [Supabase Database Docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/overview).

Click the "Start your project" button.\
This will bring you to a page to Sign Up for an account.

I opted to "Continue with GitHub" and authorized my GitHub account to create my Supabase account.\
Once an account is created, the page will redirect to a "Create a new organization" form.

The form asks for:
- Name: An organization name.
- Type: The chosen organization type.
- Plan: A plan applied to this new organization.

{class="custom-image-size-class"}

> I chose the free plan because I ain't looking to spend until I gotta.

After filling out the form, click "Create Organization".\
This will redirect to a page with a "Create a new project" form.

The form asks for:
- Organization: This should auto populate to the organization just created.
- Project name: A project name.
- Database Password: Setting a password for the project.
- Region: Select the region closest to the primary users.

Additional, Security Options and Advanced Configuration can be adjusted.\
I decided to keep the defaults for my project.

Click "Create new project" to finalize the form.
